# snyth-pd

Skeleton implementation of_snyth_ experimental additive synthesiser in PureData. For a detailed description, 
user guide and examples, please see the parent repository [README](https://github.com/transcriptaze/snyth).

This is very much a work-in-progress and there honestly isn't much here other than a bare bones proof of concept
because most of the development effort is currently being focused on the WebAudio implementation. But one of these
days.....
